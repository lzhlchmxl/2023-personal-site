              <p>When I was a young child, I had this "mission" to spread more music in the world. </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I would pause middle of where I was going and play any piano I came across.
                It didn't matter if it was in a classroom, a supermarket, a music shop, a bar, or a street piano 
                â€“ to me, each one had its own story to tell.

                I would try to feel the emotions and imagine the story of each piano, and then let my fingers do the "talking".
                I used to say that I was "just a medium, letting out the sound of the piano itself." 
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                While I now realize that it might be a bit silly, I still cherish every moment of it.
